        <h1>S: Strong</h1>
        <p><u>God's word to you:</u> <br> 
            “Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. 
            Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, 
            and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.”
        
            <br>
            Matthew 11:28-30 NIV</p>

        <br>

        <p><u>My word to you:</u> 
            <br>
            If you didn't know but I call you an hard fighting soldier because that's exactly who you are.
            You are a woman who does exactly what this verse above says. You go to Jesus when you're weary, burdened,
            when you're tired, happy, you just take and find rest in Him and I find that truly inspiring and I know 
            other women both disciples and non-disciples see that and are inspired as well.

        <h1>T: The Very Daughter of God</h1>
        <p><u>God's word to you:</u> <br> 
            And a voice from heaven said, “This is my Daughter, whom I love; with him I am well pleased.”

            <br>
            Matthew 3:17 NIV
        </p>

        <br>

        <p><u>My word to you:</u> 
            <br>
            Before you did anything, before you started discipling anyone, before you baptised anyone, God
            clearly claimed you as his daughter and said he loves and he is well pleased with you.

            <br>

            Don't ever think you need to do anything crazy to earn Gods love. God loves you just because you
            made that decision almost 3 years to declare Jesus as your Lord and Saviour in your life. He is well pleased with you, 
            he loves you and he's fired up to see you in heaven!

            <br>
            Now of course, this doesn't mean don't have no deeds to show your faith but just always remember that
            God calls you his <b>daughter</b>, one he <b>loves</b> and he is <b>well pleased</b> with.
            Always remember that my sister!

        <h1>E: Extremely Encouraging</h1>
        <p><u>God's word to you:</u> <br> 
            So encourage each other and build each other up, just as you are already doing.
            <br>
            1 Thessalonians 5:11 NLT
        </p>

        <br>

        <p><u>My word to you:</u> 
            <br>
            What else can I say about madam encouragement. You encourage people with your smile, with 
            your positive perspective on things, with your love for God, buying them food (FEED HIM, ENCOURAGE HIM), 
            not just getting them gifts for vibes but actually thinking of what will help them get closer to God.
            
            You are the really an example of what it means to encourage and build people up so thank you
            for being you.

        <h1>L: Loving</h1>
        <p><u>God's word to you:</u> <br> 
            So now I am giving you a new commandment: Love each other. Just as I have loved you, 
            you should love each other. Your love for one another will prove to the world that you are my disciples.”
            <br>
            John 13:34-35 NLT
        </p>

        <br>

        <p><u>My word to you:</u> 
            <br>
            YOU ARE A DISCIPLE! YOU ARE A DISCIPLE OF CHRIST WHO CLEARLY LOVES GOD, HIS PEOPLE AND THE LOST.
            And this verse makes things incredibly clear that by your love for each other, people will
            know that you are a disciple of Christ and well, you definitely show that love and I know that 
            people most definitely see that in you so thank you for being a loving disciple of Christ :)

        <h1>L: La Femme Aux Convictions Pieuses</h1>
        <p><u>God's word to you:</u> <br> 
            And the people of Berea were more open-minded than those in Thessalonica, and they listened 
            eagerly to Paul’s message. They searched the Scriptures day after day to see if Paul and Silas 
            were teaching the truth. As a result, many Jews believed, as did many of the prominent Greek women and men.
            
            <br>
            Acts 17:11-12 NLT
        </p>

        <br>

        <p><u>My word to you:</u> 
            <br>
            Now, you must be wondering what does the phrase I put there or you might have searched it up. If you haven't,
            the phrase simply means the woman with godly convictions. Who is that you ask? It's you.
            <br>
            You are a woman who has convictions, strong biblically convictions and like you put in your status on
            WhatsApp "You don't change the world with the ideas in your head, but with the convictions
            in your heart". 

            <br>
            Continue being a woman with convictions, a woman that God is going to use powerfully to build up 
            his kingdom and use to help heal many women out there!!!

        <h1>A: An Amazing Friend</h1>
        <p><u>God's word to you:</u> <br> 
            Oil and perfume make the heart glad; 
            So does the sweetness of a friend’s counsel that comes from the heart.
