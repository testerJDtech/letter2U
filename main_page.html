        <h1>S: Strong</h1>
        <p><u>God's word to you:</u> <br> 
            “Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. 
            Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, 
            and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.”
        
            <br>
            Matthew 11:28-30 NIV</p>

        <br>

        <p><u>My word to you:</u> 
            <br>
            If you didn't know but I call you an hard fighting soldier because that's exactly who you are.
            You are a woman who does exactly what this verse above says. You go to Jesus when you're weary, burdened,
            when you're tired, happy, you just take and find rest in Him and I find that truly inspiring and I know 
            other women both disciples and non-disciples see that and are inspired as well.

        <h1>E: Extremely Encouraging</h1>
        <p><u>God's word to you:</u> <br> 
            So encourage each other and build each other up, just as you are already doing.
            <br>
            1 Thessalonians 5:11 NLT

        <p><u>My word to you:</u>

            What else can I say about madam encouragement. You encourage people with your smile, with 
            your positive perspective on things, with your love for God, buying them food (FEED HIM, ENCOURAGE HIM), 
            not just getting them gifts for vibes but actually thinking of what will help them get closer to God.
            
            You are the really an example of what it means to encourage and build people up so thank you
            for being you.

        <h1>L: Loving</h1>
        <p><u>God's word to you:</u> <br> 
            So now I am giving you a new commandment: Love each other. Just as I have loved you, 
            you should love each other. Your love for one another will prove to the world that you are my disciples.”
            <br>
            John 13:34-35 NLT
        </p>

        <br>

        <p><u>My word to you:</u> 
            <br>
            YOU ARE A DISCIPLE! YOU ARE A DISCIPLE OF CHRIST WHO CLEARLY LOVES GOD, HIS PEOPLE AND THE LOST.
            And this verse makes things incredibly clear that by your love for each other, people will
            know that you are a disciple of Christ and well, you definitely show that love and I know that 
            people most definitely see that in you so thank you for being a loving disciple of Christ :)

        <p><u>God's word to you:</u> <br> 
            Oil and perfume make the heart glad; 
            So does the sweetness of a friend’s counsel that comes from the heart.
